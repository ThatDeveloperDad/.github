As I build projects during my live streams, I will make the source code available here.

All of the public repositories I publish under this organization are free to use.  Fork, Download, Copy-Paste-Modify as you see fit.  Do what you need to do with them.  (I'll put a CC License on each of them as they get added.)

That said, the code in these repositories is presented as-is and for educational purposes, without guarantee of success or suitability for your particular needs. 

Additionally, there is no licensing fees, costs for content, I don't want to do any "freemium" stuff here.  I will be posting a link to my Ko-Fi page with these repositories, and will gratefully accept contributions if my work here helps you.  Once there's some code available, I'll likely open things up for sponsorships, but that's a little ways off just yet. :)

- Those things are free and only take a second or two, and they help a LOT!!!!
